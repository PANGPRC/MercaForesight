# MercaForesight - Scripts Directory

## **Directory Overview**
This folder contains project-related scripts for supporting various automation tasks, such as data processing, deployment, and maintenance.

---

## **Usage Guidelines**
1. Organize scripts into subdirectories based on their functionality (e.g., `data_processing/`, `deployment/`, `monitoring/`).
2. Ensure all scripts are executable and include clear comments explaining their purpose and usage.
3. Use descriptive filenames to indicate the script's functionality (e.g., `backup_database.sh`, `generate_report.py`).
4. Test scripts thoroughly in a staging environment before using them in production.

## **Notes**
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) in scripts; use environment variables or secure storage solutions instead.
- Document the dependencies and prerequisites for each script (e.g., required libraries, runtime environments).
- Regularly review and update scripts to ensure compatibility with the latest project requirements.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate effectively on script development.
