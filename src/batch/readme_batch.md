# MercaForesight - Batch Processing Module

## **Directory Overview**
This folder contains code related to batch processing tasks. Batch processing is used for handling large-scale data transformations, scheduled jobs, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines within the MercaForesight platform.

---

## **Purpose**
- Automate data processing tasks that do not require real-time execution.
- Handle large-scale data transformations efficiently.
- Support scheduled jobs for periodic data updates and reporting.

## **Usage Guidelines**
1. Organize batch processing code into appropriate subdirectories based on functionality.
2. Ensure all scripts and modules are well-documented with clear comments and usage instructions.
3. Use logging to track the execution of batch jobs and identify potential issues.
4. Test batch jobs in a staging environment before deploying them to production.

## **Notes**
- Optimize batch jobs for performance to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Use configuration files or environment variables to manage job parameters and avoid hardcoding values.
- Monitor batch job execution using tools like cron logs or external monitoring systems.
