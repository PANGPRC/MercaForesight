# MercaForesight - Streaming Module

## **Directory Overview**
This folder contains code related to streaming data processing tasks. Streaming processing is used to handle real-time data ingestion, transformation, and analysis within the MercaForesight platform.

---

## **Purpose**
- Process real-time data streams for immediate insights and actions.
- Enable event-driven architectures for responsive and scalable systems.
- Integrate with message brokers (e.g., Kafka) to handle high-throughput data streams.

## **Usage Guidelines**
1. Organize streaming code into appropriate subdirectories based on functionality.
2. Use logging to monitor the performance and health of streaming jobs.
3. Ensure fault tolerance by implementing retry mechanisms and error handling.
4. Test streaming pipelines in a staging environment before deploying them to production.

## **Notes**
- Optimize streaming jobs for low latency and high throughput.
- Use configuration files or environment variables to manage connection details and processing parameters.
- Monitor streaming pipelines using tools like Kafka monitoring dashboards or custom metrics.
