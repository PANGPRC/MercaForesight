## **Notes**
- Ensure that sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) is not hardcoded in the source files. Use environment variables instead.
- Test all new code thoroughly before committing it to the repository.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate effectively with the team.
