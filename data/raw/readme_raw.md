# Raw Data Directory

This folder is used to store raw, unprocessed data files as obtained from their original sources.

## Usage Guidelines
- Raw data files should be stored in their original format without any modifications.
- Use descriptive filenames that include the data source and date (e.g., `customer_data_2025-01-01.csv`).
- If the raw data is too large or sensitive, consider storing it externally and referencing it here.

## Notes
- Do not modify raw data files directly; instead, create processed versions in the `processed/` directory.
- Ensure that raw data files are properly documented, including their source, collection date, and any relevant metadata.
