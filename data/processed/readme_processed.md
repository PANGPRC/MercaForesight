# MercaForesight - Processed Data Directory

This folder is used to store processed data files that have been cleaned, transformed, or aggregated for analysis or modeling purposes.

## Usage Guidelines
- Processed data files should be named descriptively to indicate their content and processing date (e.g., `sales_summary_2025-01-01.csv`).
- Organize files into subfolders if necessary, based on data type or purpose.

## Notes
- Ensure that processed data files are derived from raw data stored in the `raw/` directory.
- Document any transformations or processing steps applied to the data in a separate log or metadata file.
