# Kafka Configuration

This folder contains configuration files related to the Kafka service.

## Purpose
- Set up and manage Kafka as a message broker for the project.
- Facilitate communication between different services or components.

## Current Files
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the Docker configuration for running Kafka.
- `.env`: Environment variables for configuring Kafka (e.g., broker ID, log directories).

## Usage Guidelines
- Use `docker-compose up -d` to start the Kafka service.
- Verify that Kafka is running by connecting to the broker using a Kafka client or CLI.
- Use `docker-compose down` to stop and remove the Kafka container.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `.env` file is properly configured before starting the service.
- Avoid exposing Kafka ports to the public internet without proper security measures.
- Monitor Kafka logs for troubleshooting (`docker logs <container_name>`).
