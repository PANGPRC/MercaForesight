# MercaForesight - Infrastructure Directory

## **Directory Overview**
This folder contains infrastructure configuration files to support the project's runtime environment, deployment, and scalability needs. It includes scripts and templates for provisioning, configuring, and managing the project's infrastructure.

---

## **Content Structure**
- **`docker/`**: Contains Dockerfiles and related configurations for containerizing the application.
- **`terraform/`**: Includes Terraform scripts for provisioning cloud resources.

---

## **Usage Guidelines**
1. Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes to infrastructure files and ensure collaboration.
2. Test all infrastructure changes in a staging environment before applying them to production.
3. Follow best practices for security, such as encrypting sensitive data and using environment variables for secrets.
4. Document all infrastructure components and their dependencies for easier maintenance.

---

## **Notes**
- Ensure that all infrastructure scripts are compatible with the project's runtime environment and dependencies.
- Regularly review and update infrastructure configurations to align with evolving project requirements.
- Use automation tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) to simplify infrastructure management and reduce manual errors.
