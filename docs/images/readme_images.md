2. Use compressed image formats (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`) to minimize file size and improve loading performance.
3. Organize images into subfolders if necessary for better categorization (e.g., `diagrams/`, `screenshots/`).
4. Maintain consistent naming conventions (e.g., lowercase letters with underscores).
