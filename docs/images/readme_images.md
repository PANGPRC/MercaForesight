# Images Directory

This folder is used to store image assets related to the project documentation.

## Usage Guidelines
- Images should be named descriptively to reflect their purpose (e.g., `dashboard_overview.png`).
- Use compressed image formats (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`) to minimize file size.
- Organize images into subfolders if necessary for better categorization.

## Notes
- Ensure that all images included here are relevant to the documentation.
- Avoid storing sensitive or copyrighted images without proper permissions.
